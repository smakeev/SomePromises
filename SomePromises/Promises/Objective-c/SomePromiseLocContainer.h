//	class SPFabric
//	Provides standard loc container.
//
//NOTE!: Is not thread safe.
//
//	You may create a fabric wich will be responsable for
//	creating an object with particular properties and values.
//
//	Just register the class in the fabric and register all classes
//	and values it will need.
//
//	Also allows to make object creation process on separate thread using future (SomePromiseFuture)
//	This also means it could be a start point for some promise chain.
//
//	NOTE!: It is probably closer to builder pattern than to the fabric.
//
//	NOTE!: Not threadsafe.
